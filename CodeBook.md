"subject" - this variable represents the id numbers of all the  people who participated in the experiment,
there were 30 people engaged in the experiment


"activity" - this variable desribes the activity performed during the measurement, there were 6 ativities in the experiment: 
"WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING"

The list of variables displayed on the bottom of this file is present in the final dataset (in addition to "subject" and "activity").


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals
tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant
rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals
were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

All the variables represent the average  of the previously normalized values
for each activity and each subject.

- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
